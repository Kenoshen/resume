## Projects

<div class="indent">

**Ludum Dare 36: Sporg's Mishap**<br>
*August 2016*<br>
_with: Jacob Caban-Tomski, Logan Moore_

This game is a platformer where you have to run around and collect all of the pieces of your ship.  We were able to include some unique polish items like beginning and ending cutscenes as well as some AI pathfinding.  It ended up as a fairly polished finished product.

---

**Global Game Jam 2016: Tarant**<br>
*January 2016*<br>
_with: Jacob Caban-Tomski, Logan Moore, Tanner Moore_

Our team has typically used LibGDX for all our jams. This time around we wanted to give GameMaker a try after seeing some really polished things come out of the last LudumDare that used GameMaker. This game is designed to be played with XBox controllers (the only ones fully supported by GameMaker)

---

**Ludum Dare 34: Dendrite**<br>
*December 2015*<br>
_with: Jacob Caban-Tomski, Tanner Moore, Logan Moore_

The theme was a tie between "Growing" and "Two Button Controls". The game that we developed in the end turned out to be a platformer version of Mario Kart. You and 3 friends (or AI opponents) race to get to the finish line while also grabbing power ups and collecting coins to purchase upgrades. The game ended up getting the highest "Fun" rating we've had on any of our games as well as breaking 4.0 (out of 5) in the "Graphics" rating.

**JS13KGames Competition: Capture the Flag**<br>
*September 2015*

This was a solo competition that I entered that involved creating a Javascript/HTML5 game in a couple weeks that had to be less than 13 kilobytes in size when it was turned in. I decided to participate in the Server section of the competition (the other sections being Mobile and Desktop) to try and learn more about Web Socket technology. I ended up creating a simple 2-player capture the flag game that would match you up against another person or an AI if there was no one online. And all within 13KB!

---

**Ludum Dare 33: Scabs**<br>
*August 2015*<br>
_with: Tanner Moore, Logan Moore_

The theme was "You are the monster". We decided to create a side scrolling beat'em'up with a hobo that gets transported to the future. We were able to create some really great lighting effects (with the help of a new tool called SpriteDLight) as well as a really awesome cutscene at the beginning of the game.

---

**Ludum Dare 32: Gician**<br>
*April 2015*<br>
_with: Jacob Caban-Tomski, Tanner Moore, Logan Moore_

The theme was "An Unconventional Weapon". We built the game around the idea that you were playing both as a baby wizard, and the player (playing the baby wizard). In other words, because you were just a baby wizard, you couldn't attack. However, if you used your mouse, you could attack enemies. So things like: clicking, dragging/dropping, moving the mouse fast across an enemy became your attacks. It is as if you are protecting the baby wizard as you navigate him through each level.

**Global Game Jam 2015: Quadramaniacs**<br>
*January 2015*<br>
_with: Jacob Caban-Tomski, Tanner Moore, Logan Moore_

Quadramaniacs is a 4 player coop platforming puzzle game meant to answer the theme question for GGJ2015 of "What should we do now?". Each of the 4 players has a unique set of skills that they must use in collaboration in order to move forward.

---

**Global Game Jam 2014: Office Life**<br>
*January 2014*<br>
_with: Jacob Caban-Tomski, Tanner Moore, Logan Moore_

Office Life is a game meant to respond to the GGJ2014 theme "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are". It is not so much of a game as it is an interactive story about a man who works in an office to one day find that his world as been flipped upside down.

---

**GPU Accelerated 3D Particle System**<br>
*January 2012 to May 2012*

This is a particle system I made in XNA using HLSL. The particle data is stored in textures that are passed to the GPU so all calculations are done on the GPU instead of the CPU. It uses a component-based design model which makes it simple to design different particle effects.

---

**2D Particle System**<br>
*January 2012*

I made this 2D particle system to get a better understanding of what the CPU was capable of in terms of processing particles. It was the kind of the inspiration for my GPU Accelerated Particle System. I thought that if I could make a pretty fast, and really cool-looking, 2D particle system that ran on the CPU, I could make something even cooler using 3D and the GPU.
